### BScProject

```
Student Profile Management System
```

### Problem Statement
```
Student Profile Management System is software developed for student profile containing records all important 
information needed by the teachers and students and which are needed by the college. Medical ID is also provided 
to the student in their profile and in case of emergencies a message is sent to their parents. This system also 
allows a student to view their academic progress, current assignments, academic information etc. Student’s parents 
can also keep track of their children activity and the parents can also communicate with the teacher with the 
information that will be provided in the system as well.
```

### Limitations
```
Being a vast project, there are limitation and things that need to be done gradually are stated below:
1. Validation of few pages where the input is given by the user is not complete.
2. For medical registration page, the verification of all information provided by the student. 
   Example: Medical Certificate should be uploaded as proof.  
3. For attendance page month dates validation comparing it with the number of total lecture and 
   number of lectures attended.
4. Gateway for online transfer of fees.
5. For Fee Record Entry page, retrieving information using the student’s ID and computing through 
   program the remaining fees by fetching the course fees set by the school/college and total fees paid by 
   the student.
6. Automated message to the parents.
```

### Future Enhancements
```
The project has a very vast scope in future. The project can be implemented in a much better way in near future. 
Project can be updated in near future as and when requirement for the same arises, as it is very flexible in terms 
of expansion. Overcoming the above limitations can hence run the entire project in a much better, accurate, user 
friendly and error free manner. The following are the future scope for the project.
1. Automated message to the parents from the college so that they can keep track on their children academics.
2. Online payment of fees.
3. Proper validations for all pages and completion of project.
